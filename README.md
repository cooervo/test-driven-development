# TDD

An effective method for performing, unit testing is to conduct testing in **parallel** with implementation. In fact,
an effective way to build quality in to an implementation is to specify the tests that an implementation must pass 
before writing the code. After writing such a test, one adds to the implementation until the test succeeds.

### Unit testing:

Breaking down the logic of your application into small chunks or 'units', and verifying that each unit works as desired, makes for a very happy and resilient app lifecycle!

The core units which make up features should be verified with accompanying unit tests. In JavaScript apps, the smallest units of code you can test are usually individual functions.
